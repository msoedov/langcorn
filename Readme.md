## üì¶ Installation

To get started with LangCorn, simply install the package using pip:

```shell

pip install langcorn
```

## ‚õìÔ∏è Quick Start

Example LLM chain ex1.py

```python

import os

from langchain import LLMMathChain, OpenAI

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "sk-********")

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)
```

Run your LangCorn FastAPI server:

```shell
langcorn server examples.ex1:chain


[INFO] 2023-04-18 14:34:56.32 | api:create_service:75 | Creating service
[INFO] 2023-04-18 14:34:57.51 | api:create_service:85 | lang_app='examples.ex1:chain':LLMChain(['product'])
[INFO] 2023-04-18 14:34:57.51 | api:create_service:104 | Serving

[INFO] 2023-04-18 14:34:57.51 | api:create_service:106 | Endpoint: /examples.ex1/run
INFO:     Started server process [27843]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8718 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

or as an alternative

```shell
python -m langcorn server examples.ex1:chain

```

Run multiple chains

```shell
python -m langcorn server examples.ex1:chain examples.ex2:chain


[INFO] 2023-04-18 14:35:21.11 | api:create_service:75 | Creating service

[INFO] 2023-04-18 14:35:21.82 | api:create_service:104 | Serving

INFO:     Started server process [27863]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8718 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Import the necessary packages and create your FastAPI app:

In `main.py`,

```python

from fastapi import FastAPI
from langcorn import create_service

app:FastAPI = create_service("examples.ex1:chain")
```

Multiple chains

```python

from fastapi import FastAPI
from langcorn import create_service

app:FastAPI = create_service("examples.ex2:chain", "examples.ex1:chain")
```

or

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from langcorn import create_service

app: FastAPI = create_service(
    "examples.ex1:chain",
    "examples.ex2:chain",
    "examples.ex3:chain",
    "examples.ex4:sequential_chain",
    "examples.ex5:conversation",
    "examples.ex6:conversation_with_summary",
)

```

Run your LangCorn FastAPI server:

```shell

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Now, your LangChain models and pipelines are accessible via the LangCorn API server.

## Auth

It possible to add a static api token auth by specifying `auth_token`

```shell
python langcorn server examples.ex1:chain examples.ex2:chain --auth_token=api-secret-value
```

or

```python
app:FastAPI = create_service("examples.ex1:chain", auth_token="api-secret-value")
```

## Custom API KEYs

```shell
POST http://0.0.0.0:3000/examples.ex6/run
X-LLM-API-KEY: sk-******
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Handling memory

```json
{
  "history": "string",
  "input": "What is brain?",
  "memory": [
    {
      "type": "human",
      "data": {
        "content": "What is memory?",
        "additional_kwargs": {}
      }
    },

        "additional_kwargs": {}
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

Response:

```json
{
  "output": " The brain is an organ in the human body that is responsible for controlling thought, memory, emotion, and behavior. It is composed of billions of neurons that communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals. It is the most complex organ in the body and is responsible for all of our conscious and unconscious actions.",
